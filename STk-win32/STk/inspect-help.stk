STk-inspect\n\n
STk-inspect is a graphical inspector for STk (the Scheme/Tk based language).

It is the firt step toward a more general debugger . For now, it only permits to visualize and modify STk objects.

General inspector


The General inspector is the simplest tool to trace STk objects. It allows you to watch and modify every kind of object.

To inspect an object

You can use the STk 

        (inspect object) 

command. For instance, if you want to inspect the variable my-variable, just type:
          STk> (inspect 'my-variable)

You can also select the Inspect option in an other STk-inspect tool (detailer, viewer,...).

To uninspect an object

You can use the STk

        (uninspect object) 

command, or you can select the Uninspect option in the Icon menu associated with the object line inspector.

Screen organization                   

The General inspector is a toplevel window divided in 2 areas: a menu bar and a list of all inspected objects.

Menu area
Menu area comports two buttons:

         Command menu
         The Uninspect all option uninspects all inspected objects and destroy the           General inspector window.
         The Undebug option destroys all the STk-inspect toplevel windows.

         Help menu
         The STk-inspect option gives a general help about STk-inspect.
         The General inspector option gives this help.

Inspected objects area
Each line of the list concerns one object, a line is divided in 3 fields:

        The Object field contains the inspected object.

        The Value field contains the value of the object (the result of the object evaluation). You can modify the object by editing this field. A <Return> validation affects to the object the result of the field contents evaluation, while a <Shift-Return> validation  affects to the object the field contents without evaluation.

        The Icon provides actions on the object.

Detailer

A detailer is a STk-inspect tool which allows you to see STk objects with more details.

For instance, a list detailer shows you the structure of a list where you can edit each element of the list; a procedure detailer permits you to edit the body of a procedure; a widget detailer allows you to access directly the whole option fields of a widget; and so on...

For now, there are detailers for lists, pairs vectors, procedures and widgets.

To detail an object

You can use the STk 

        (detail object)

command. For example, if you want to detail the list my-list, type:

        STk> (detail my-list)

You can also select the Detail option in an other STk-inspect tool (inspector, viewer, ...).

To undetail an object

You can use the STk 

        (undetail object)

command or you can select the Undetail option in the Command menu of the object detailer window.
